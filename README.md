## Is it possible to use machine learning models to predict teams points totals accurately enough to win money over the course of a season?
### The idea of this project is to use different regression models with different parameters, to then predict a teams points score being over or under the bookies prediction, simulate each game using the real result and to then finally analyse if enough predictions were successfully made to gain a return on the original investment.

# ML-Project-NBA-Predictor
## Machine Learning Project | Bootcamp TheBridge
### Is there a way to predict NBA teams points accuratly enough to win money over the course of a season?
### The idea of this project is to use different regressors, using different parameters, to then simulate each game using the data available, estimate a points score being over or under the bookies prediction, to then analyse if enough predictions were successfully made to win a return.
